# Chie - A minimal discord bot for Discord

## Starting up the bot
Setting up the bot is very easy. All you have to do is to edit the config.json file.
```yaml
# Set this to "true" if you prefer using environmental variables.
"USE_SYS_ENV": false

# Your application's "Bot TOKEN".
"TOKEN": "TOKEN",

# Command prefix.
"COMMAND_PREFIX": "-"
```
---
## Prerequisites
All you need is Python(at least version 3.10.x). You can then install the required modules using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
